## About the project

The `ft_irc` project is an implementation of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server in C++. The objective is to reproduce the functionality of a real IRC server, allowing multiple clients to connect, join channels, and communicate in real-time.

### Project Features

- **Multi-client Handling**: Supports multiple clients connecting simultaneously without hanging.
- **Channel Management**: Clients can create, join, and leave channels.
- **Private Messaging**: Supports private messages between users.
- **Channel Operator and User Roles**: Distinguishes between normal users and operators, with specific commands for operators.
- **Command Support**: Implements essential IRC commands such as `JOIN`, `PRIVMSG`, `KICK`, and more.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dardangerguri/ft_irc.git
   cd ft_irc
   ```

2. Compile the server by running `make`
   
3. Start the IRC server by running the server executable with the desired port number and server password
   ```bash
   ./ircserv <port> <password>
   ```

4. Connect with an IRC Client or connect using netcat

     If you connect with an IRC Client we recommend using irssi
      ```bash
      irssi
      ```
      and connect
      ```bash
      /connect 127.0.0.1 <port> <password> [<nick>]
      ```
   
      If you connect using netcat:
      ```bash
      nc -c localhost <port>
      ```

## Usage Examples

Here are some common IRC commands you can use after connecting:

1. **Set Nickname**:

   ```bash
   /nick YourNickname
   ```
